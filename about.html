      <summary>
        <p>
         Being aware of distracted driving matters because distracted driving is a major cause of accidents on the road, which can lead to serious injuries or even fatalities. 
         Distracted driving occurs when a driver's attention is diverted away from the task of driving due to activities such as texting, eating, or using a mobile phone. By being aware of the risks of distracted driving, 
        drivers can take steps to reduce distractions and stay focused on the road, which can help prevent accidents and keep themselves and others safe.

              The problem with distracted driving is that it increases the risk of accidents and can result in injuries or fatalities.
              Distracted driving affects all age ranges, but young drivers are particularly susceptible to it. According to research, drivers aged 16-24 are more likely to engage in distracted driving than any other age group. 
              This is partly due to their lack of experience on the road and overconfidence in their driving abilities. However, distracted driving can affect anyone, regardless of age or experience.
              Distracted driving not only affects the driver but also other road users, including pedestrians and cyclists. It is estimated that distracted driving is a factor in up to 25% of all car accidents, 
              with texting while driving being one of the most dangerous forms of distraction. To reduce the risk of accidents and promote safer driving, it is important for all drivers to avoid distractions while behind the wheel 
              and focus on the task of driving.

    <b>Visual Distracted Driving </b> 
    <p>
    The visual type of distracted driving refers to any activity that takes a driver's eyes off the road. This can include looking at a mobile phone, reading a map, adjusting the radio, or any other activity that requires the driver to take their eyes off the road. Visual distractions are particularly dangerous because they can cause drivers to miss important 
    information, such as traffic signals, road signs, or other vehicles on the road, and can lead to accidents or collisions. It's important for drivers to keep their eyes on the road at all times to avoid visual distractions and ensure safe driving.

    <b>Manual Distracted Driving </b>
    <p>
    The manual type of distracted driving refers to any activity that requires a driver to take their hands off the steering wheel. This can include adjusting the radio, eating or drinking, applying makeup, or any other activity that requires the driver to use their hands for something other than steering the vehicle. Manual distractions can be 
    dangerous because they can cause a driver to lose control of the vehicle and increase the risk of accidents or collisions. It's important for drivers to keep both hands on the steering wheel at all times and avoid any activities that require them to use their hands while driving.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
  
    
    <b>Cognitive Distracted Driving </b>
    <p>
    The cognitive type of distracted driving refers to any activity that takes a driver's mind off the task of driving. This can include daydreaming, talking on the phone, texting, or any other activity that causes a driver 
    to lose focus on the road. Cognitive distractions can be particularly dangerous because they can cause a driver to miss important cues, such as changes in traffic patterns, road conditions, or the behavior of other drivers. 
    They can also impair a driver's ability to make quick decisions or react to unexpected events, which can lead to accidents or collisions. It's important for drivers to remain alert and focused while driving and avoid any activities that can distract them mentally.
