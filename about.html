         Being aware of distracted driving matters because distracted driving is a major cause of accidents on the road, which can lead to serious injuries or even fatalities. 
         Distracted driving occurs when a driver's attention is diverted away from the task of driving due to activities such as texting, eating, or using a mobile phone. By being aware of the risks of distracted driving, 
        drivers can take steps to reduce distractions and stay focused on the road, which can help prevent accidents and keep themselves and others safe.

    <b>Visual Distracted driving </b> 
    <p>The visual type of distracted driving refers to any activity that takes a driver's eyes off the road. This can include looking at a mobile phone, reading a map, adjusting the radio, or any other activity that requires the driver to take their eyes off the road. Visual distractions are particularly dangerous because they can cause drivers to miss important information, such as traffic signals, road signs, or other vehicles on the road, and can lead to accidents or collisions. It's important for drivers to keep their eyes on the road at all times to avoid visual distractions and ensure safe driving.</p>
