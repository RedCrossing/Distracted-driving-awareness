        <p>
         Being aware of distracted driving matters because distracted driving is a major cause of accidents on the road.
         Distracted driving occurs when a driver's attention is diverted away from the task of driving due to activities such as texting, eating, or using a mobile phone. By being aware of the risks of distracted driving, 
        drivers can take steps to reduce distractions and stay focused on the road, which can help prevent accidents and keep themselves and others safe.

              The problem with distracted driving is that it increases the risk of accidents and can result in injuries or fatalities.
              Distracted driving affects all age ranges, but young drivers are particularly susceptible to it. According to research, drivers aged 16-24 are more likely to engage in distracted driving than any other age group. 
              This is partly due to their lack of experience on the road and overconfidence in their driving abilities.
