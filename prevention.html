                   Unless it’s an emergency (and in that case you should pull over), keep your phone stowed away in the glove compartment or out of your line of vision. Set your phone on “Do Not Disturb” mode or use one of these safe driving apps to avoid getting distracted by texts, calls, and notifications.

                <figure>
                    Multitasking is a myth. Our brains are not designed to do more than one thing. If you think it’s totally safe to talk on your hands free phone while driving, think again. Eating a snack, glancing out the window, or searching for an item takes your mind and eyes off the road, increasing the chance of an accident.

                    You are likely to enocunter many diffrent types of drivers on the road, some of which will vary in skill and mood. Stay calm and focus on driving. You should also avoid driving while upset, angry, or stressed

                <figure>
                    Teen drivers are at a much higher risk of driving distracted. Out of teens ages 15-20 who were involved in fatal crashes, 7% were reported as distracted – the largest of any age group. If you are a parent of a teen driver, encourage them to follow the “S-M-A-R-T” method:

                     <h2>ASK PASSENGERS FOR HELP</h2>
                </div>
               
                <figure>
                    If you have passengers in the car, ask them for help navigating, adjusting music or climate controls, and responding to important texts or calls. However, limit your conversations, as they can be very distracting.
